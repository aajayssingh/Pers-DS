This is trivial/README.

This is the most trivial example I could come up with to illustrate
how to memory map Persistent Memory, store a few bytes to it, and
make the stores durable.  The example is totally self-contained in
a single file.  No hard problems are solved in this example -- it
just shows you how to use mmap() and msync().

To build this use:
	make

To run a trivial test use:
	make test
